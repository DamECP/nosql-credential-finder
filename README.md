# MongoDB NoSQL Injection Password Extractor

This Python script exploits a NoSQL injection vulnerability in a MongoDB-backed web application to retrieve the list of users and extract their passwords.  
It was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate the risks of NoSQL injection and serve as a practical exercise in cybersecurity training.

## Features

- Automatically enumerates all known users on the target.
- Retrieve length of the password before extracting password character-by-character using regex-based queries.
- Basic error handling for connection issues and timeouts.
- Parses HTML responses using BeautifulSoup.
- Simple command-line interface to select target users.

## Educational Context

This project is based on a **[TryHackMe challenge](https://tryhackme.com/room/nosqlinjectiontutorial)**.
The goal is to understand how NoSQL injections work, learn to automate exploitation with Python, and raise awareness about secure web development practices.
